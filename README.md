## Introduction
The Messier objects are a set of 110 astronomical objects catalogued by the French astronomer **Charles Messier** in his Catalogue des Nébuleuses et des Amas d'Étoiles ("Catalogue of Nebulae and Star Clusters"). This catalogue consists of a diverse range of astronomical objects, from star clusters and nebulae to galaxies. 
For example, **Messier 1** is a supernova remnant, known as the **Crab Nebula**, and the great spiral **Andromeda Galaxy** is **M31**.

## What this project does
Given the messier object number, you will be presented with the details of concerned object, its projection in **Mollweide View**, and a plot of stars in its vicinity or the **skymap** of the object. This has been done with the help of **Astropy library**.
